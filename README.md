Separate_UMAPs.R - contains UMAP analyses done by R.

aa_freq.py - calculates the freuqencies of each aminoacid in the human proteome (FASTA file obtained from UniProt)

seq_complexity_plot.R (&seq_complexity_plot_nonamyloid.R) - generates a 3D plot of sequence complexity-aminoacid frequency-number of matches in the human proteome.

logP - calculates logP values of given aminoacid sequences based on an additional method (Tao et. al.)
